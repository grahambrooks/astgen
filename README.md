# Abstract Tree Generator (astgen)

This is a simple tool to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) from a given source code file.

It uses pre-built https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/ grammars to parse the source code and generate an AST in JSON format and outputs the AST for each parsed file as a single line of JSON. One line per file.
